#Guide to Settlement Planning W.I.P

 Due to the difficultly of the game it is better to form a group then to survive alone, which means you should try to make a good enough dwelling to attract others
to your settlement. Here are the main steps of plotting your future city.

 Step one of planning a settlement involves the position of resources such as puddles(Water), wildlife(Food), forests(Lumber), mountains(Ores), and rivers(Water+Food). 
Find a puddle and start planning out the position of it from the foundation of your home, build a small 3x3 road out of dirt with the puddle in the middle this will act as your settlement center you can cover the dirt road up later with cobble or roman roads
now since this is your settlement's center you will want to have a road attached to it; for early ages (5000 B.C. - 1873 A.D.) a 3x3 to 5x5 road will do but for later ages (1903 A.D. - 2013 A.D.) you will want a road at around 8x8+2 for vehicular travel and travel by person (the 2+ is for the 1x1-2x2 sidewalks on the side of the 8x8)
spacing the roads from your buildings will give you spaces for telegraphs and mailboxes.

 Step two of planning a settlement requires you to be able to find any local wildlife just to make sure the location is viable for the amount of time it takes to setup, After you get past that part you should see about fixing up your first settlement building each room as a 5x5 for the greatest amount of room but make sure the rooms dont block roads and are made out of an abundant material (Wood or Clay)
